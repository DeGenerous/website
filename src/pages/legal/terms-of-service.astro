                    Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate
                    administrative control over your User Account and the

                  <li>
                    Organizations. The "owner" of an Organisation (any type of

                    ultimate administrative control over that Organisation and

                    An Organisation may have multiple owners, but there must be
                    at least one User Account designated as an owner of an
                    Organisation. We will consider the first registered user

                    responsible party for the DeGenerous Society Services.

                In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of

                <br />
                If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that
