        <b>Limitation of Liability</b>
        <br />

        profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary
        damages, however arising, that result from
        <ul class="default-ul">
          <li>the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;</li>
          <li>your use or inability to use the Service;</li>
          <li>any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service;</li>
          <li>the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;</li>
          <li>unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;</li>

          </li>
          <li>any other matter relating to the Service.</li>
        </ul>
        Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages,
        and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
        We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

        <b>Release and Indemnification</b>
        <br />
        If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release DGRS Labs Pte. Ltd. and its
        directors, officers, employees, and contractors from any and all claims, demands and damages
        (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in
        any way connected with such disputes.
        <br />
        You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims,
        liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website
        and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.
        <br />
        This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments,
        fines, litigation costs, and legal fees. If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities,
        including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms.
        For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms
        don’t override those immunities.
        <br />
        For full clarity, DGRS Labs Pte. Ltd. will not be responsible for the following liabilities:
        loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings; indirect
        or consequential loss; punitive damages. DGRS Labs Pte. Ltd.’s total liability arising out of
        or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) €500 or (2) 125% of the fees that
        you paid to use the relevant services in the 3 months before the breach.
