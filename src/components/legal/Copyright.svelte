    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>3. Counter-Notice Procedure</h4>
    If your content is removed due to a copyright complaint and you believe it was removed in error or
    due to misidentification, you may submit a
    <b>counter-notice</b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Your counter-notice must contain:
    <ol class="default-ol">
      <li>Your full legal name, address, phone number, and email.</li>
      <li>
        A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been
        infringed and its original location on CoNexus or on another Website and/or User Interface
        belonging to a DGRS Labs Pte Ltd Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief the content was
        removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Jurisdiction Consent:</b>
        <ul class="default-ul">
          <li>
            If you are in the U.S., you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal district
            court for your address.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are outside the U.S., you consent to the jurisdiction of the courts in Singapore,
            unless otherwise required by applicable law.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A statement that you will accept service of process from the complainant or their authorized
        agent.
      </li>
      <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    Upon receiving a valid counter-notice, we will notify the complainant. Unless the complainant files
    legal action within the time period required by law (e.g., 10–14 business days for DMCA cases), we
    may restore the content.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>4. Repeat Infringer Policy</h4>
    CoNexus enforces a strict repeat infringer policy in line with global safe harbor standards:
    <ul class="default-ul">
      <li>
        A <b>“strike”</b> is issued when content is removed due to a valid copyright complaint.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users receiving <b>three (3) strikes within any rolling six-month period</b> may have their accounts
        suspended or permanently terminated.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may, at our discretion, issue warnings or provide educational resources before
        termination.
      </li>
      <li>We track strikes across all user accounts and associated identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h4>5. Misuse of the Complaint Process</h4>
    Submitting false or misleading notices or counter-notices may result in account suspension or legal
    consequences under applicable laws (including potential liability for damages under the DMCA in the
    U.S.).
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>6. Governing Law</h4>
    <ul class="default-ul">
      <li>For DMCA matters, applicable U.S. copyright law and jurisdiction rules apply.</li>
      <li>
        For all other matters, unless otherwise required by applicable law, this Policy and any
        disputes will be governed by the laws of Singapore, with jurisdiction in the courts of
        Singapore.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h4>7. Reservation of Rights</h4>
    We reserve the right to:
    <ul class="default-ul">
      <li>
        Remove or disable access to any content alleged to be infringing, without prior notice, in
        our sole discretion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Terminate or suspend accounts at any time for repeat infringement or other violations of the
        DGRS Labs Pte. Ltd. Terms of Service and the related Privacy Policy.
