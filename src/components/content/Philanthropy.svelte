      <h2>Proof-Of-Impact: Turning Digital Contributions into Real Change</h2>
      <h3>
        At DeGenerous DAO, we believe that philanthropy should be transparent,
        engaging, and impactful. With our initial NFT sale raising $125K for
        charity, we've already demonstrated the power of Web3 to drive
        real-world change. Thanks to our partnership with Lions Clubs
        International, we ensure that 100% of funds raised for charity go
        directly to those in need through well-organized, co-branded global
        service missions. Our vision is to gamify giving, allowing supporters to
        earn unique NFTs, traits, and aesthetics as proof of their
        contributions—each digital asset telling a story of generosity, woven
        into a larger movement of social good.

      <h2>Make the World a Better Place. Unlock Your Potential.</h2>
      <h3>
        Philanthropy isn’t just about donations—it’s about measurable,
        life-changing impact. From funding international service trips to
        empowering communities, DeGenerous DAO is committed to ensuring that
        every contribution translates into direct action. As humanitarian
        partners of Lions International, the world’s largest service
        organization with 1.4M members and 50K local clubs, we’ve helped fund
        multiple $100K+ global service projects, including a major initiative in
        India in February 2024, where our community shaped the mission through
        innovative governance systems. True impact isn’t measured in bytes, but
        in smiles, shared stories, and lives forever changed.
