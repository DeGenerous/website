      <h5>Proof-of-Impact: Philanthropy meets digital gamification.</h5>
      <p>
        We've funded multiple <b>$100k+ humanitarian missions</b>, improving the
        lives of over <b>100,000 lives globally</b>. In partnership with
        <b>Lions Clubs International</b>, our initiatives combined
        <b>blockchain transparency</b> with real-world service - organizing service
        trips to India, Morocco, Kenya, and beyond, to deliver direct, measurable
        support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our story began with an NFT mint where hundreds of generous degens
        proved that digital assets could fuel real-world change. Since then,
        weâ€™ve helped raise <b>millions more for charity</b>, tying Web3
        engagement to a global movement for good.
