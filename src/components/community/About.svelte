    Our community became official in <time datetime="2023-02"
      >February 2023</time
    >
    under the name of <strong>DeGenerous DAO</strong>. It began with an NFT
    collection that raised <strong>$125k</strong> for charity. As an on-chain
    DAO, we organized a global service mission and, in partnership with Lions
    Clubs International Foundation, raised and donated much more over the years.
    The collection eventually evolved into the <strong>Potentials</strong>, and
    with it, our commitment deepened: building impactful products for a
    community defined by purpose.
