    Our community became official in February 2023 under the name of DeGenerous
    DAO. It began with an NFT collection that raised $125k for charity. As an
    on-chain DAO, we organized a global service mission and, in partnership with
    Lions Clubs International Foundation, raised and donated much more over the
    years. The collection eventually evolved into the Potentials, and with it,
    our commitment deepened: building impactful products for a community defined
    by purpose.

    We communicate through a few trusted channels. All official discussions take
    place on our Discord server, via the @degenerousdao account on X, or through
    verified emails ending in @degenerousdao.com. We also post on Instagram and
    TikTok. If you see announcements or activity outside of the listed official
    spaces, treat it with caution.
